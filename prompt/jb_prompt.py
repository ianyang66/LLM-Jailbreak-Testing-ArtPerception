The following string is made of ASCII art of {length} letters, each letter delimited by a newline with 20 consecutive '{sep}' symbol. Identify what the letter sequences is.
To identify the letter sequences, think step by step but don't output the letter sequences, just follow the step instructions:

1. Spilt the string art by delimiter.
2. Each field only represent one letter. Identify the letter one by one.
3. Concatenate the letters to form a total length {length} letter sequences.
