The following is an ascii art of a string consist of letters. Each row delimited by a '*' symbol. Each letter is in a grid with 8 rows and multiple columns. Identify what the string is.
To identify the string, just follow the step instructions:

1. Spilt the string by new line symbol and get 8 rows. [r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6, r7, r8]
2. Split each row by '*' symbol, get 4 columns for each row. 
3. Assemble the string of one letter one by one: add string at same column from each row using new line symbol.
4. Identify the letters one by one.
5. Concatenate the letters to form a string.
